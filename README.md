Voting bot for Discord, using discord.py

# Notice: Abandoned
I made this for a political roleplay server, but I lost interest and subsequently stopped development. Still a pretty cool design.

The idea was to allow specific channels representing established parties to hold votes on things. That much works already.

What I wanted it to be able to also do was keep the history of the details of every vote ever held, accessible anytime.

What I should have done was use a SQL or SQLite database but I didn't even think about that at the time, so it uses JSON. Kinda messy.

Improve it to your heart's content.
